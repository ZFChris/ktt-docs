- **Team:** Jester
- **Goal:** Get killed by another player to win the game.
- **Chance:** ?% per round
- **Minimum Players:** ?
- **Characteristics:**
  - The Jester is a neutral role whose primary goal is to get killed by another player. To accomplish this, they do not deal any damage, making them a non-threat to others.
  - The Jester must be careful, as shooting at players without dealing damage might reveal their role. This could lead to an early death if others catch on.
  - If the Jester is killed, the team that kills them wins, so the Jester needs to cleverly manipulate others into killing them, while avoiding being too obvious.
  - The Jester's ability to confuse and mislead can create unique moments where players must decide whether or not they should take the risk of killing the Jester, as it might be a trap.
