- **Characteristics:**
  - The Mute is an Innocent role who cannot use text chat in-game, is muted in Discord and can also not equip any weapons.
  - The Mute can pick up weapons but cannot equip or use them.
  - They have a fast-updating radar that provides valuable location information but is not entirely accurate. The radar has a 10-second timer, but the information may be delayed, making it potentially misleading.
  - Since the Mute cannot deal damage, they need to find ways to communicate the information from their radar to trusted players. They must convince others that their information is trustworthy.
