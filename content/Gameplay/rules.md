## ยง1 Random Death Match

No RDM (Random Death Match)\
So don't kill others without reason. (recommended IRL too)

## ยง2 Don't talk after death

Don't talk after you died! (You should get muted automatically)\
After a revive you are allowed to talk again. (Except the Shinigami)

## ยง3 Recordings/Streams

Recordings/streams are generally allowed and encouraged! (please post your content in #watchables on Discord)\
By joining this server and Discord voice-channels you automatically consent to being recorded.
