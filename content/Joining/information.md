# How to play

To join the server do the following:

## 1 Install [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/) and [Counter-Strike: Source](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/).

If you are missing one or maybe even both, feel free to buy them via my ref-links:

[Counter-Strike: Source](https://www.gamivo.com/product/counter-strike-source-steam-gift?glv=karl) (Gamivo)

If you are enjoying playing TTT with us, I'd really appreciate a donation: ~~https://ko-fi.com/vertikarl~~ (currently disabled)\
Though you can check out my [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/vertiKarl) and subscribe over there! (Will most likely stream TTT aswell)

### (recommended) 1.1 Increasing connection speed

To reduce the wait when joining for the first time, I'd recommend to subscribe to and download the [workshop collections](#subscribe-to-the-workshop-collection) (with all addons) in advance.\

**You need to click "Subscribe to all" and also repeat that for all the linked collections.**

## 2 Joining the Server

Choose one of the following options to connect or join via a friend.

### 2.1 Join options

#### 2.1.1 Legacy server browser

In the main menu, go to "Find Multiplayer Game" then head over to "Legacy Server Browser" and choose "Favorites" in the tabbar.\
In there click "Add server by IP-Address". Then insert:
`ttt.karlology.eu`.\
After that either join via the console providing a password or go back to the regular Server browser and join via the Favorites tab!

#### 2.1.2 Server browser

Search for "Karl in Terrorist Town" and join, providing a password!

#### 2.1.3 Join link

You need to generate a new join link each session. You can do this over on this website:
https://vertikarl.github.io/ttt-page/
just insert the password (listed on Discord) and click "Generate Link!". Then either click the link or copy the link and insert it in your browser and open it via Steam.

### (optional) 2.2 Save password

Type in your console:
`password x` (x representing the current password)\
That should save the password until you change it manually.\
To open the console you need to bind it to a key via the settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Subscribe to the workshop collection

Make sure to subscribe not only to the main collection but also all collections linked in it:\

### Check the password

Make sure the password you entered is valid.

### Check DNS and connection
